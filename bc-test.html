<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Leeland to Open Bible Conference with a Night of Worship</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Join us for a meaningful opening night as <strong>Leeland</strong> leads worship to begin this year&rsquo;s Bible Conference. Based in Texas, Leeland is led by singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist <strong>Leeland Mooring</strong>, alongside guitarist and co-writer <strong>Casey Moore</strong>. Together, they have become one of the most recognizable voices in modern worship music.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Since emerging in the mid-2000s, Leeland has released multiple albums and received <strong>four GRAMMY&reg; nominations</strong> and <strong>eight GMA Dove Award&reg; nominations</strong>. Their music is deeply shaped by the local church, with songs often born out of shared worship experiences rather than performance-driven settings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mooring is also a co-writer of the widely sung worship anthem <strong>&ldquo;Lion and the Lamb,&rdquo;</strong> a song embraced by congregations around the world. Known for crafting worship that invites participation, Leeland&rsquo;s opening night concert sets a reflective and unifying tone for the weekend ahead.</p>
