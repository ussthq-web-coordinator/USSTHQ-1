He loves playing basketball in the gym, hanging out in the teen room with his friends and helping around the center when he can. Grier is a respectful young man who understands how valuable his future is, something that wasn’t clear to him when he was younger.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">Grier describes his younger self as angry and explosive. He would throw tantrums when he didn’t get his way. Felicia Cohen, the site director for the Red Shield Youth Center on Belmont Avenue, remembers his behavior all too well.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">“He would blow up out of nowhere,” said Cohen. “The smallest things just set Micah off.”</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">Cohen and her staff would often pull Grier out of group activities to let him calm down. It’s a technique Cohen uses frequently with the students.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">“Sometimes they get explosive and can’t control their emotions,” said Cohen. “Once they calm down, I give them a few minutes to sit in the office. Then I ask, ‘ok, what happened?’ and then they talk.”</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">That kind of space was necessary for Grier to express himself, but more importantly, to build his trust with the staff. Over time, Cohen and other camp counselors became mentors for Grier, supporting him both inside and outside the youth center. They attended his football and basketball games, spent time with him during his lunch period and were there for him during difficult life events.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">“My first year of middle school, a lot had changed in my environment,” said Grier. “But then I realized that I could talk to people about what was going on and what I was going through.”</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">One of the people Grier felt he could talk to was Cohen. During their one-on-one time together, there was one piece of advice she gave that stayed with him.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">“You can’t let anything control you,” Grier recalls.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">Now entering his sophomore year of high school, Grier is a junior staff member and a role model for other children. He helps keep the youth center clean by taking out the trash, sweeping, and mopping the floors. He also assists camp counselors with the younger groups by facilitating games and taking attendance. He takes on additional roles, such as helping with lunch distribution and making copies for activities. Most importantly, he’s having fun and making friends every day.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">“When he was younger, I could see him being a leader. He just didn’t know how to show it yet,” said Cohen. “Being in this environment, he had to help others. We told him, ‘Micah, we need you to step up. ’ He has leadership skills, and putting him in a place to be a leader is what I believe helped him.”</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">Grier is currently on his high school football team and has a 3.2 GPA. He has his eyes set on attending his dream school, Florida State University, when he graduates from high school. He is interested in studying IT and aspires to play in the NFL.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">“He’s come a long way, and I’m proud of him,” said Cohen.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">Grier feels proud of himself too, saying he no longer lets his emotions control him. He’s focused on school, protecting his mom and sister and searching for a part-time job.

He loves playing basketball in the gym, hanging out in the teen room with his friends and helping around the center when he can. Grier is a respectful young man who understands how valuable his future is, something that wasn't clear to him when he was younger.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">Grier describes his younger self as angry and explosive. He would throw tantrums when he didn't get his way. Felicia Cohen, the site director for the Red Shield Youth Center on Belmont Avenue, remembers his behavior all too well.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">"He would blow up out of nowhere," said Cohen. "The smallest things just set Micah off."</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">Cohen and her staff would often pull Grier out of group activities to let him calm down. It's a technique Cohen uses frequently with the students.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">"Sometimes they get explosive and can't control their emotions," said Cohen. "Once they calm down, I give them a few minutes to sit in the office. Then I ask, 'ok, what happened?' and then they talk."</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">That kind of space was necessary for Grier to express himself, but more importantly, to build his trust with the staff. Over time, Cohen and other camp counselors became mentors for Grier, supporting him both inside and outside the youth center. They attended his football and basketball games, spent time with him during his lunch period and were there for him during difficult life events.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">"My first year of middle school, a lot had changed in my environment," said Grier. "But then I realized that I could talk to people about what was going on and what I was going through."</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">One of the people Grier felt he could talk to was Cohen. During their one-on-one time together, there was one piece of advice she gave that stayed with him.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">"You can't let anything control you," Grier recalls.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">Now entering his sophomore year of high school, Grier is a junior staff member and a role model for other children. He helps keep the youth center clean by taking out the trash, sweeping, and mopping the floors. He also assists camp counselors with the younger groups by facilitating games and taking attendance. He takes on additional roles, such as helping with lunch distribution and making copies for activities. Most importantly, he's having fun and making friends every day.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">"When he was younger, I could see him being a leader. He just didn't know how to show it yet," said Cohen. "Being in this environment, he had to help others. We told him, 'Micah, we need you to step up. ' He has leadership skills, and putting him in a place to be a leader is what I believe helped him."</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">Grier is currently on his high school football team and has a 3.2 GPA. He has his eyes set on attending his dream school, Florida State University, when he graduates from high school. He is interested in studying IT and aspires to play in the NFL.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">"He's come a long way, and I'm proud of him," said Cohen.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">Grier feels proud of himself too, saying he no longer lets his emotions control him. He's focused on school, protecting his mom and sister and searching for a part-time job. Most of all, he's excited for next summer to create more memories at the Red Shield Youth Center.</p></article></div></div>","{Identifier}":"Lists%252fRSYCStories%252f10_.000","{IsFolder}":false,"{Thumbnail}":{"Large":null,"Medium":null,"Small":null},"{Link}":"https://sauss.sharepoint.com/sites/THQITDWeb/_layouts/15/listform.aspx?PageType=4&ListId=711db2e7%2D7538%2D42cb%2Da5e7%2Ddc01441a2015&ID=10&ContentTypeID=0x01002A15BE31328D18458A44FDF2485FEC6900E39BA42C61369D41980A4214A459AA14","{Name}":"Edit Story Entry","{FilenameWithExtension}":"Edit Story Entry","{Path}":"Lists/RSYCStories/","{FullPath}":"Lists/RSYCStories/10_.000","{ContentType}":{"@odata.type":"#Microsoft.Azure.Connectors.SharePoint.SPListExpandedContentType","Id":"0x01002A15BE31328D18458A44FDF2485FEC6900E39BA42C61369D41980A4214A459AA14","Name":"Item"},"{ContentType}#Id":"0x01002A15BE31328D18458A44FDF2485FEC6900E39BA42C61369D41980A4214A459AA14","{HasAttachments}":true,"{VersionNumber}":"4.0"}]
